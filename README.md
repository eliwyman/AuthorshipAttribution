# AuthorshipAttribution
Predicting author given song lyrics, using k-nearest neighbour and feed forward neural networks.


  What makes a Taylor Swift song a Taylor Swift song? What makes a Beatles song a Beatles
song? Is it only a musical rhythm, an instrument, or can it be something else?
	
This project aims to employ various machine learning technologies, including supervised
classification algorithms in the form of nearest neighbour and feedforward neural network models. 
An exploration of the data, and its structure and characteristics will
proceed the design discussion. The experiment design, based on intuitions and assumptions of
song lyrics and algorithms will be outlined. Follows will be a description of the strategy of
approach, including the selection, implementation and evaluation of several models. Finally, the
results of the experiments, and their findings and implications on the project will be presented,
with potential next steps and improvements identified from promising adjacent work in the field
