The Beatles,artist/The-Beatles/3644,Introduction,/lyric/34441490/The+Beatles/Introduction,"Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

And tell her that I'm all alone

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, ""Daddy, everything's all right""

Peter Brown called to say, You can make it OK, You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.  Christ! You know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be. The way things are going, They're going to crucify me.  Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton, Talking in our beds for a week.

The way things are going, They're going to crucify me. Saving up your money for a rainy day, Giving all your clothes to charity.  Last night the wife said, Oh boy, when you're dead you  Don't take nothing with you but your soul think! Made a lightning trip to Vienna, Eating chocolate cake in a bag.  The newspapers said, She's gone to his head, They look just like two Gurus in a drag. Christ! You know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be.  The way things are going, They're going to crucify me. Caught the early plane back to London, Fifty acorns tied in a sack.

Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game ""Existence"" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning",0:02:55,2002

To a registered charity. 
All I need is a pint a day 
If I ever get outta here

As we fell into the sun, 
And the first one said to the second one there 
I hope you're having fun.

And the jailer man and sailor Sam 
Were searching every one 
For the band on the run,

Seeing no one else had come, 
And a bell was ringing in the village square 
For the rabbits on the run.

And the jailer man and sailor Sam 
Were searching every one 
For the band on the run,

Yeah the band on the run,
Band on the run

Well, the night was falling as the desert world 
Began to settle down. 
In the town they're searching for us everywhere 
But we never will be found.

Will search for evermore

Alone a boy was standing  And when I asked him why,  He turned with eyes that could not see  And he began to cry.   I'm nobody's child,  I'm nobody's child.  Just like the flowers  I'm growing wild.  I got no mummy's kisses  I got no daddy's smile.  Nobody wants me,  I'm nobody's child.   No mummy's arms to hold me  Or sue me when I cry,  'cause sometimes I feel so lonesome  I wish that I could die.  I'll walk the streets of heaven  Where all blinds can see.   And just like for the other kids  It will be a home for me.   I'm nobody's child,  I'm nobody's child.  Just like the flowers  I'm growing wild.  I got no mummy's kisses  I got no daddy's smile.

Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

The man in the mac said you've got to go back, You know they didn't even give us a chance.  Christ! You know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be. The way things are going, They're going to crucify me. Finally made the plane into Paris, Honeymooning down by the Seine.  Peter Brown called to say, You can make it OK, You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.  Christ! You know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be. The way things are going, They're going to crucify me.  Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton, Talking in our beds for a week. The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed, I said we're only trying to get us some peace.  Christ! You know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be. The way things are going, They're going to crucify me. Saving up your money for a rainy day, Giving all your clothes to charity.  Last night the wife said, Oh boy, when you're dead you  Don't take nothing with you but your soul think! Made a lightning trip to Vienna, Eating chocolate cake in a bag.  The newspapers said, She's gone to his head, They look just like two Gurus in a drag. Christ! You know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be.  The way things are going, They're going to crucify me. Caught the early plane back to London, Fifty acorns tied in a sack. The men from the press said we wish you success, It's good to have the both of you back.  Christ! You know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be. The way things are going, They're going to crucify me",0:00:00,

And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain, very strange.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass, And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. A four of fish and finger pies In summer. Meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she's in a play, She is anyway.  In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim, And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain - very strange.

Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

On our way back home

Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle
